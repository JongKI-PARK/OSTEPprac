# Homework (simulation)
With process-run.py , you can see the process state as it runs on the CPU. 
Process can have four different states(RUNNING, READY, WAITING, DONE) in this code.

1. 1. Run process-run.py with the following flags: -l 5:100,5:100. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?) Why do you know  this? Use the -c and -p flags to see if you were right.


2.
