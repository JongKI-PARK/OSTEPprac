# The Abstraction : Address Spaces

Virtual memory has a well-defined layout, which is called address space. Therefore, when a process is created, the process is said to have an address space according to a well-defined layout.  

There are three main goals of Virtual Memory (VM). The first is Transparancy. Transparancy means that the user (process) should not care about memory size or available space. The second is Efficiency. It has to be efficient in terms of time or memory space. For this, a lot of hardware support is needed (TLB). Third, protection of the area between processes is required. Memory areas used by other processes should not be accessible.  


## Homework

> **1. The first Linux tool you should check out is the very simple tool free. First, type man free and read its entire manual page; it’s short, don’t worry!**

A : `free.txt` is for question 1. By `$ man free > free.txt`, `free.txt` is made. According to this manual, it displays amount of free and used memory in the system with the information gathered from /proc/meminfo.

<br><br>

> **2. Now, run free, perhaps using some of the arguments that might be useful (e.g., -m, to display memory totals in megabytes). How much memory is in your system? How much is free? Do these numbers match your intuition?**

  ```
  $ free
                total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
  Mem:       24487976      543264    22021184       47624     1923528    23521436
  Swap:       8388604           0     8388604

  ```

<br><br>

> **3. Next, create a little program that uses a certain amount of memory, called memory-user.c. This program should take one command line argument: the number of megabytes of memory it will use. When run, it should allocate an array, and constantly stream through the array, touching each entry. The program should do this indefinitely, or, perhaps, for a certain amount of time also specified at the command line.**

A : `memroy-user.c` is for question 3. 

<br><br>

**4. Now, while running your memory-user program, also (in a different terminal window, but on the same machine) run the free tool. How do the memory usage totals change when your program is running? How about when you kill the memory-user program? Do the numbers match your expectations? Try this for different amounts of memory usage. What happens when you use really large amounts of memory?**

A: Command to terminal `$ memory-user 100 0`  
before : 
  ```
  $ free -m
                total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
  Mem:          23914         551       20245          46        3117       22923
  Swap:          8191           0        8191
  ```
after : 
  ```
  $ free -m
                total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
  Mem:          23914         552       20244          46        3117       22923
  Swap:          8191           0        8191
  ```
  I allocated 100MB memory for this program but `free` shows that system only used 1MB. 
  
<br><br>

**5. Let’s try one more tool, known as pmap. Spend some time, and read the pmap manual page in detail.**

A : `man pmap` see `man_pmap.txt`. According to the manual of pmap, refernces [1], [2], [3] and [4], one line in pmap print for a contiguous mapping of each hardware translation page size(unit of 4KB).  
Virtual addresses are displayed in ascending order.  
For anaonymous memory(anon), it is reported for the process heap, stack, 'copy on write' pages with mappings mapped with MAP_PRIVATE.  
'total' at the bottom of the results in pmap, shows the process's total logical memory size.  

<br><br>

**6. To use pmap, you have to know the process ID of the process you’re interested in. Thus, first run `ps auxw` to see a list of all processes; then, pick an interesting one, such as a browser. You can also use your memory-user program in this case (indeed, you can even have that program call getpid() and print out its PID for your convenience).**

A : I used `ps auxw | grep memory-user` to find out pid.

  ```
  $ ps auxw | grep memory-user
  kipark    166078 68.8  0.0 104892  1412 pts/0    R+   14:11   0:38 ./memory-user 100 0

  $ pmap 166078

  ```
The result shows

**7. Now run pmap on some of these processes, using various flags (like -X) to reveal many details about the process. What do you see? How many different entities make up a modern address space, as opposed to our simple conception of code/stack/heap?**

A : 
  
<br><br>

**8. Finally, let’s run pmap on your memory-user program, with different amounts of used memory. What do you see here? Does the output from pmap match your expectations?**

A : More details are shown by `pmap -x option`. See below.
