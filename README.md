This is mainly for OSTEP book homework <br>
<em> MAR. 27. 2022 ~ </em> <br/>

There are solutions to homework that exist in the OSTEP book (Operating Systems : Three Easy Pieces) , but there are also codes to solve personal questions. Personal questions may or may not exist for each chapter, and will be described separately in the "Furthermore" section. See README.md in each chapter. There exists personal opinion and any feedback related to my opinion is welcomed.  
OSTEP book pdf is available at https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/
