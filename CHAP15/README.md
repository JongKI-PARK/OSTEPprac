# Homework

**1. Run with seeds 1, 2, and 3, and compute whether each virtual address generated by the process is in or out of bounds. If in bounds, compute the translation.**

  ```
  $ python3 relocation.py --seed=1
  ARG seed 1
  ARG address space size 1k
  ARG phys mem size 16k

  Base-and-Bounds register information:

    Base   : 0x0000363c (decimal 13884)
    Limit  : 290

  Virtual Address Trace
    VA  0: 0x0000030e (decimal:  782) --> PA or segmentation violation?
    VA  1: 0x00000105 (decimal:  261) --> PA or segmentation violation?
    VA  2: 0x000001fb (decimal:  507) --> PA or segmentation violation?
    VA  3: 0x000001cc (decimal:  460) --> PA or segmentation violation?
    VA  4: 0x0000029b (decimal:  667) --> PA or segmentation violation?

  For each virtual address, either write down the physical address it translates to
  OR write down that it is an out-of-bounds address (a segmentation violation). For
  this problem, you should assume a simple virtual address space of a given size.
  ```

  ```
  $ python3 relocation.py --seed=2

  ARG seed 2
  ARG address space size 1k
  ARG phys mem size 16k

  Base-and-Bounds register information:

    Base   : 0x00003ca9 (decimal 15529)
    Limit  : 500

  Virtual Address Trace
    VA  0: 0x00000039 (decimal:   57) --> PA or segmentation violation?
    VA  1: 0x00000056 (decimal:   86) --> PA or segmentation violation?
    VA  2: 0x00000357 (decimal:  855) --> PA or segmentation violation?
    VA  3: 0x000002f1 (decimal:  753) --> PA or segmentation violation?
    VA  4: 0x000002ad (decimal:  685) --> PA or segmentation violation?

  For each virtual address, either write down the physical address it translates to
  OR write down that it is an out-of-bounds address (a segmentation violation). For
  this problem, you should assume a simple virtual address space of a given size.

**2. Run with these flags: -s 0 -n 10. What value do you have set -l (the bounds register) to in order to ensure that all the generated virtual addresses are within bounds?**

<br><br><br>

**3. Run with these flags: -s 1 -n 10 -l 100. What is the maximum value that base can be set to, such that the address space still fits into physical memory in its entirety?**

<br><br><br>

**4. Run some of the same problems above, but with larger address spaces (-a) and physical memories (-p).**

<br><br><br>

**5. What fraction of randomly-generated virtual addresses are valid, as a function of the value of the bounds register? Make a graph from running with different random seeds, with limit values ranging from 0 up to the maximum size of the address space.**
